# Andrew Doan - Plalia Code Challenge 1 
 Assumptions Made:
 1. For this challenge, its best to use the express generator and modify to complete.
 2. Since this is a small application for a challenge, assumed it would be best to just write some logic in the app.js and index.js route page instead of further modularizing it.
